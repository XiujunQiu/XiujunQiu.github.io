### Project
NYC Taxi Tip Prediction

### Summary
- This project analyzed tipping behavior in NYC for-hire vehicles using high-volume trip record data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The dataset covers trips from January 2022 to August 2023 and includes details like pickup/drop-off times, locations, distances, and fares. The goal was to build a machine-learning model to predict tip amounts based on trip-related features to uncover insights into tipping patterns.
